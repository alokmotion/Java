  <summary>Question: 1 Problem: Galactic Arithmetic</summary>

  
In a far-off galaxy named Arithmetica, beings have been using a newly discovered number system to make their life easier. However, they are facing difficulties in performing basic arithmetic operations. As the resident genius of planet Earth, you have been called upon to help them. Your first task is to build a function that will be able to add two numbers in their number system.

Function:

public static long galacticAddition(long num1, long num2);

Inputs:

The function galacticAddition(long num1, long num2) will receive two parameters:

num1 : a long integer representing the first number in the Arithmetica number system.

num2 : a long integer representing the second number in the Arithmetica number system.

Outputs:

The function will return a long - the sum of num1 and num2 in the Arithmetica number system.

Sample Input:

125678

9876543210L

Sample Output:

9876668888L

Note:

In the sample input, the two numbers provided to the function are 125678 and 9876543210. The sum of these two numbers is 125678+9876543210=9876668888, so the function returns 9876668888 as the output. Your task is to help the beings of Arithmetica perform this basic operation with ease. Good luck, Earth's genius!

  <summary>Question:2 Problem: Arithmetic Operations</summary>

  You are a programmer in a school. The mathematics teacher has asked for your help to teach basic arithmetic operations to students. Your task is to create a set of functions that will do subtraction, multiplication, division, and find the remainder of two numbers.

Functions:

public static int subtractNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static int multiplyNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static double divideNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static int findRemainder(int num1, int num2);

Inputs:

Each function will receive two parameters:

¬∑ num1 : an integer which represents the first number.

¬∑ num2 : an integer which represents the second number.

Outputs:

1. The subtractNumbers function will return an integer - the result of subtracting num2 from num1.

2. The multiplyNumbers function will return an integer - the result of multiplying num1 and num2.

3. The divideNumbers function will return a double - the result of dividing num1 by num2.

4. The findRemainder function will return an integer - the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.

Sample Input:

subtractNumbers(20, 5);

multiplyNumbers(4, 5);

divideNumbers(20, 4);

findRemainder(10, 3);

Sample Output:

15

20

5.00

1

Note:

In the sample input, the numbers given to the functions are (20, 5), (4, 5), (20, 4) and (10, 3) respectively. The functions correctly return the results of subtraction, multiplication, division and finding the remainder.

Sample Input:  
joinStrings("Hello, ", "World!"); 
  
Sample Output:  
"Hello, World!" 
  
Note:  
In the sample input, the function is given two strings: "Hello, " and "World!". These two strings are concatenated to form "Hello, World!", which is the output. Make sure your function works properly to display the user's full name correctly on the social networking site.

 <summary>Question 5: 
 Problem: The Journey Calculator 
</summary>

 You are a developer at a transportation company. The company is developing a new app that helps users track their journey. One of the features of the app is to calculate the distance travelled given the speed and time of the journey. Your task is to create a method that takes speed and time and returns the distance travelled. This method should be a non-static method and should be implemented inside a class named JourneyCalculator. 
  
Class Definition: 
  
public class JourneyCalculator { 
    public double calculateDistance(double speed, double time); 
} 
  
  
Inputs: 
  
The method calculateDistance(double speed, double time) will receive two parameters: 
‚Ä¢	speed : a double representing the speed of the vehicle in km/h. 
‚Ä¢	time : a double representing the time travelled in hours. 
  
Outputs: 
  
The method will return a double - the distance travelled. Round off the result to 2 decimal places. 
  
Sample Input: 
  
JourneyCalculator journeyCalculator = new JourneyCalculator(); 
journeyCalculator.calculateDistance(60.0, 1.5); 
  
Sample Output: 
  
90.00 
  
  
Note: 
  
In the sample input, the user's speed is 60 km/h and the time travelled is 1.5 hours. The distance travelled is speed*time = 60*1.5 = 90 kilometers, so the method returns 90.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping users track their journey accurately. Good luck, developer!

 <summary> Question 6: 
Problem: The Temperature Converter 
</summary>

 You are working as a software developer at a weather forecasting company. The company is developing a new feature for their app that allows users to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Your task is to create a method that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius.  
  
Hint: The formula to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:  
C = (F - 32) * 5/9 
  
Where: 
‚Ä¢	C is the temperature in Celsius 
‚Ä¢	F is the temperature in Fahrenheit 
  
Class Definition: 
public class TemperatureConverter { 
    public double convertFahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit); 
} 
  
Inputs: 
The method convertFahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit) will receive one parameter: 
‚Ä¢	fahrenheit : a double representing the temperature in Fahrenheit. 
  
Outputs: 
The method will return a double - the temperature converted to Celsius.  
  
Sample Input: 
TemperatureConverter temperatureConverter = new TemperatureConverter(); 
temperatureConverter.convertFahrenheitToCelsius(68.0); 
  
Sample Output: 
20.00 
  
Note: 
  
In the sample input, the user's temperature in Fahrenheit is 68.0. The temperature in Celsius is (68 - 32) * 5/9 = 20.00, so the method returns 20.00 as the output. Your method will be crucial in helping users understand the temperature in Celsius. Good luck, developer!

 <summary>Question 7 : 
 Problem: Semester Marks Averager 
</summary>


 You are creating a student portal for your school. The portal needs to display the average marks of a student for 8 semesters. Your task is to write a Java function that takes the marks of each semester individually and returns the average. 
  
Function: 
  
public static double calculateAverage(int sem1, int sem2, int sem3, int sem4, int sem5, int sem6, int sem7, int sem8); 
  
  
Inputs: 
  
The function calculateAverage(i85sem7, int sem8) will receive eight parameters: 
‚Ä¢	sem1, sem2, sem3, sem4, sem5, sem6, sem7, sem8 : Eight integers each representing the total marks obtained in a semester. 
  
Outputs: 
  
The function will return a double - the average marks over 8 semesters.   
Example: 
  
Sample Input: 
  
calculateAverage(85, 79, 91, 76, 88, 95, 80, 85); 
  
  
Sample Output: 
  
84.88 
  
  
Note: 
  
In the sample input, the marks for the 8 semesters are given. The average of these marks is (85+79+91+76+88+95+80+85)/8 = 84.88. So, the function returns 84.88 as the output. Make sure your function calculates the average correctly to display accurate information on the student portal.
