  <summary>Question: 1 Problem: Galactic Arithmetic</summary>

  
In a far-off galaxy named Arithmetica, beings have been using a newly discovered number system to make their life easier. However, they are facing difficulties in performing basic arithmetic operations. As the resident genius of planet Earth, you have been called upon to help them. Your first task is to build a function that will be able to add two numbers in their number system.

Function:

public static long galacticAddition(long num1, long num2);

Inputs:

The function galacticAddition(long num1, long num2) will receive two parameters:

num1 : a long integer representing the first number in the Arithmetica number system.

num2 : a long integer representing the second number in the Arithmetica number system.

Outputs:

The function will return a long - the sum of num1 and num2 in the Arithmetica number system.

Sample Input:

125678

9876543210L

Sample Output:

9876668888L

Note:

In the sample input, the two numbers provided to the function are 125678 and 9876543210. The sum of these two numbers is 125678+9876543210=9876668888, so the function returns 9876668888 as the output. Your task is to help the beings of Arithmetica perform this basic operation with ease. Good luck, Earth's genius!

  <summary>Question:2 Problem: Arithmetic Operations</summary>

  You are a programmer in a school. The mathematics teacher has asked for your help to teach basic arithmetic operations to students. Your task is to create a set of functions that will do subtraction, multiplication, division, and find the remainder of two numbers.

Functions:

public static int subtractNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static int multiplyNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static double divideNumbers(int num1, int num2);

public static int findRemainder(int num1, int num2);

Inputs:

Each function will receive two parameters:

¬∑ num1 : an integer which represents the first number.

¬∑ num2 : an integer which represents the second number.

Outputs:

1. The subtractNumbers function will return an integer - the result of subtracting num2 from num1.

2. The multiplyNumbers function will return an integer - the result of multiplying num1 and num2.

3. The divideNumbers function will return a double - the result of dividing num1 by num2.

4. The findRemainder function will return an integer - the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.

Sample Input:

subtractNumbers(20, 5);

multiplyNumbers(4, 5);

divideNumbers(20, 4);

findRemainder(10, 3);

Sample Output:

15

20

5.00

1

Note:

In the sample input, the numbers given to the functions are (20, 5), (4, 5), (20, 4) and (10, 3) respectively. The functions correctly return the results of subtraction, multiplication, division and finding the remainder.
